### Hi there, I'm Lena ðŸ™ƒ

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously learning web and industry standards, and ways to communicate â€” with people and machines.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on evading political censorship, sharing knowledge, integrating AI into education without losing human touch and personal attention.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently searching for ways to work on European markets remotely. I live in Russia and have Uzbekistan citizenship. I'm open to relocation to Germany, but prefer to work remotely for about a year or a half due to personal reasons.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:

âš¡ Fun fact: I thought HTML was to write books. I was 13 or so, just had my first computer with no Internet connection, but with sporadic manuals in htm files. Yay, little Lena fiercely mashing buttons and using frames to provide consistent navigation :D
